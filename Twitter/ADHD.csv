It’s in my bio to let people know they can achieve shit and be ADHD.

In the past 3 years, TikTok has taught me more about better ways to manage my ADHD than the dozen or so books and multiple doctors I saw over the years.

So yeah, I am proud to make ADHD part of who I am because it is always on. I cannot turn it off. I can only manage it. 

As a developer, teacher, speaker, organizer, manager, etc. my ADHD superpowers of hyperfocusing and extreme attention to detail have absolutely helped me excel.

I have met so many people at conferences and online that after they find out I’m ADHD, share how they’ve struggled and “are probably ADHD” but never bothered to get diagnosed.

The one year I decided not to follow my regiment or medication, I lost my house, my job, and almost my wife. We call it the “blip” year lol.

Before TikTok I can say that when I told people I was ADHD there was a lot of shame. Not many people understood what it was, and I know that some people felt I was “damaged goods” in a way. 

As I got older I didn’t give a crap anymore what people thought. So that’s why I have #ADHD in my profile and talk about it on social media time to time. Because I know there’s other people out there who feel now like I used to and don’t think there is any possible better way of living.

I’d suggest you get checked out if you truly think you have it. A combination of routine, medication, and therapy can be an amazing change for the better.

Happy to suggest some people to follow for more info, support, and tips.",schutzsmith

She also didn't want other parents to stop their kids from hanging out with me. Filipinos in general (especially during that time) lump mental illness into this one category - ""crazy"" or ""baliw"" in Filipino. And the stigma is so bad that Mom told me that hopefully, I will outgrow it. 

She said that she's also thankful that I was able to decide now that I'm older and went through the diagnosis myself. She also acknowledges how at least now in Canada, we have better mental health support and resources.

She told me FUNNY stories hahahaha and it made me feel validated even more tbh, I thought I was just a hyperactive, overachieving kid when I was younger haha!
