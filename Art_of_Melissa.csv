There are some very odd and entitled people that play this game.  Just got to brush past them and find the good ones that don’t act like this.  I have meet some very wholesome people… and some very stinky people."

Very disappointed in the quality of the items vs the price I paid.  My mask has a large crease in it at the mouth. Even if it was a small 1:10 metal/ceramic mask i would of been more happier then what I got.  Even the little wood cut out could of been a keychain!"

I banned @ZerfiX_TV as soon as he started attacking my disability on stream @TwitchSupport.  I did not want to remove their names because of the line they crossed and bring awareness to this persons actions.  I ask not to attack him but be aware of how he acts and if he attacked others in the past or even the future to know that its not them, but the toxic traits of this person. 

Step away from the game if you are this heated.
